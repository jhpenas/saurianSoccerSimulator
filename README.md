# Saurian Soccer Simulator
<sub>Developed as the Final Project for [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home).</sub>

The final application is disponible [here](http://saurian-soccer-simulator.herokuapp.com/) and the demonstration video [here](https://www.youtube.com/)

This project consists in a website, made in Flask, which has soccer simulation and statistics functions. The simulation is made using the open-source CatBoost regressor, a machine learning algorithm that uses gradient boosting on decision tree, only considering previous home and away results for the home and away teams, respectively. 

The website also has statistics tabs, where you can view dashboards and make comparations between different teams.

The database used for this application belongs to Hugo Mathien and it is disponible [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer).
